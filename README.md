In the evolving field of forensic science, voice biometrics are emerging as a powerful tool for criminal detection and investigation. This project proposes a machine learning-based voice print identification system that captures and analyzes vocal features such as pitch, tone, and cadence to create unique voice prints for individuals. Unlike traditional forensic voice recognition systems, this approach also considers voice variations due to illness (e.g., cold), ensuring more robust and accurate identification.
To achieve this, the system integrates deep learning models, voice signal processing techniques, and advanced feature extraction methods like MFFCS. A comprehensive database of voice samples will be created for training and validation, allowing the model to improve its accuracy over time. By leveraging AI-driven voice analysis, law enforcement agencies can use this technology to track and identify suspects, ultimately enhancing crime-solving efficiency while minimizing wrongful convictions.
Beyond criminal detection, the system offers applications in security, authentication, and surveillance, positioning voice biometrics as a promising frontier in forensic investigations.
